# Titanic Classifier Project

This project looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting if a passenger has survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The data for this project can be found on Kaggle.com and is often cited as the legendary 'Titanic ML Competition', mostly to familiarise oneself with ML in Python. 

Feel free to view the Jupyter notebook which contains detailed information going from:

*Getting Started*

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Clone the Repo to download all files

Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

*pypy install*

Run the requirements.txt file if using pypy manager with: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

*Anaconda/Conda install*

Run the following in a terminal: conda env create -f heart_disease_project.yml

**Future Updates**
Potential to split project into a more Class based project with my own classes for making models
More feature engineering and analysis
Potential to apply Deep Learning but using only accuracy as the metric for evaluation
